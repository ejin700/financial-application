## Webpage

The working final project is a financial application available [online](http://35.185.101.230:5050/). In addition, the financial application can be downloaded locally from Github and run in RStudio. 

## Project Aim

This project is being created for IEOR 4307 at Columbia University taught by Professor Ton Dieker during the Spring 2017 semester. The team hopes to figure out how political polling during the 2016 election cycle relates to changes in the stock market. The overall goal of this project is see if candidate Donald J. Trump's polling data can be used to predict the stock market.

## Data Soruces

This project utilizes the publicly available [2016 Election Polls](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/2016-election-polls) data set from FiveThirtyEight. Financial data is extracted via the [quantmod](http://www.quantmod.com/) financial package. There are two polling datasets. [2016 General Election Polling Data](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#plus) was found on FiveThirtyEight's *Who will win the presidency?* homepage. 
## Technology

This project is created in the R programming language and uses [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) by RStudio, a web application framework for R, that helps turn analyses into an interactive web application without knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is hosted on the Google Cloud Platform.
